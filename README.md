# Pymaceuticals

Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. This project compared the physiological responses of 250 mice treated with four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo), and drew the following conclusions:

* Mice receiving Capomulin saw a decrease in tumor volume across the 45 day treatment, while mice receiving Infubinol, Ketapril and the placebo saw an increase in tumor volume.
* The survival rate for mice receiving Capomulin is higher than the other treatments reviewed, and the number of metastatic sites for mice receiving Capomulin is less than the other treatments reviewed.
* Mice receiving Ketapril and the placebo had the highest number of metastatic sites at the end of the 45 day treatment. Mice receiving Infubinol had the lowest survival rate at the end of the 45 day treatment.
